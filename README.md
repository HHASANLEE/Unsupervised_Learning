# Unsupervised_Learning

This repository contains implementations of various unsupervised learning algorithms. These algorithms are designed to analyze and learn patterns from data without explicit labels, making them suitable for tasks like clustering, dimensionality reduction, and anomaly detection.

# Introduction
Unsupervised learning is a branch of machine learning that deals with finding hidden patterns or intrinsic structures in data without labeled outputs. Applications include customer segmentation, anomaly detection, and data preprocessing.

# Algorithms Included
This repository includes implementations of the following unsupervised learning algorithms:

1. Clustering Algorithms
K-Means
Hierarchical Clustering
DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)
Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)
2. Dimensionality Reduction Techniques
Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)
Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP)
Independent Component Analysis (ICA)
3. Anomaly Detection
Isolation Forest
One-Class SVM
Autoencoders (for anomaly detection)
4. Others
Self-Organizing Maps (SOM)
Association Rule Mining (e.g., Apriori, FP-Growth)

# Installation
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/unsupervised-learning-algorithms.git
cd unsupervised-learning-algorithms

# Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Usage
Prepare your dataset as a .csv file or similar supported format.
Choose the algorithm you want to apply.
Use the provided scripts to run the algorithm. For example:
python kmeans_clustering.py --input dataset.csv --clusters 5

# Dataset 
Input Format: The input dataset should be in tabular form with rows as samples and columns as features.
Preprocessing: Ensure the data is cleaned and scaled (if required). Missing values should be handled before applying the algorithms.

Examples
Clustering customer data:
python kmeans_clustering.py --input customer_data.csv --clusters 4

Dimensionality reduction using PCA:
python pca_reduction.py --input high_dim_data.csv --components 2
